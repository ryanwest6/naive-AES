# naive-AES
This is a basic AES encryptor and decryptor, set to run the tests present in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197, Appendix C (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf).

As the name suggests, this is only a basic implementation and should NOT be used in production.
